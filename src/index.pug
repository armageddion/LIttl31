            p Chances are pretty good that you stumbled here by accident and they are even better that we don’t want you here. So no point reading on. Really. 6o away.
            p Littl3.1 is rooted in profound laziness and relentless pursuit of the ghost of reason. Yet, no credit can be taken for any of it. It’s a gift really. Few posses it. Here, at Littl3.1 Engineering, it is aimed directly at evolutionary and technological advance of our species by being deliberately and metifulously selective.
            p As a result, most of what happens here is utterly useless. _Crap. You’re better off sitting comfortably on the conveyor belt of comformity. Really. Go away.
            p Most importantly, when this was written, only the author and the gods of science and rock’n’roll knew what the true message was.
            p Now, even the gods are wondering.

          If you’ve gotten this far, you may as well keep reading. At Littl3.1 and Bad Idea Engineering we stand behind our engineering and we stand behind our community. For this reason, self deprecation and anti-advertizing are integral part of elaborate and delicate ploy to deter an entire generation of individuals who  feel entitled to lives they don’t want to work for.

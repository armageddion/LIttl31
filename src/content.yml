    - Chances are pretty good that you stumbled here by accident and they are even better that we don’t want you here. So no point reading on. Really. 6o away.
    - Littl3.1 is rooted in profound laziness and relentless pursuit of the ghost of reason. Yet, no credit can be taken for any of it. It’s a gift really. Few posses it. Here, at Littl3.1 Engineering, it is aimed directly at evolutionary and technological advance of our species by being deliberately and metifulously selective.
    - As a result, most of what happens here is utterly useless. _Crap. You’re better off sitting comfortably on the conveyor belt of comformity. Really. Go away.
    - Most importantly, when this was written, only the author and the gods of science and rock’n’roll knew what the true message was.
    - Now, even the gods are wondering.

    At Littl3.1 and Bad Idea Engineering we stand behind our
    engineering and we stand behind our community. For this
    reason, self deprecation and anti-advertizing are integral
    part of elaborate and delicate ploy to deter an entire
    generation of individuals who  feel entitled to lives
    they don’t want to work for.

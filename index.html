Yet, no credit can be taken for any of it. It’s a gift really. Few possess it. Here, at Littl3.1 Engineering, it is aimed directly at evolutionary and technological advance of our species by being deliberately and meticulously selective.</p>
            <p class="opacity-0 transition-opacity delay-100 duration-700" data-scroll data-scroll-repeat data-scroll-class="opacity-100">As a result, most of what happens here is a series of single-servings of sheer genius, ambitious prototyping, one_of_a_kind designs and tranquil determination.</p>

Why not stuff them full of LEDs, copper and lithium? Then, all you need is a helmet or a hat to attach them to and you'll have a very unique headlamp for your next camping trip.</p>
              <p class="opacity-0 transition-opacity delay-100 duration-700" data-scroll data-scroll-repeat data-scroll-class="opacity-100">That is exactly what has happened here. Arranged in a peculiar order and with a little bit of initiative, the LEDs in the goggles can be made to display anything from your current facebook status to your favorite crypto value. We chose to render a randomly selected expression from a collection of ASCII emojis on a random timer. These goggles are a great conversation piece, a source of light and endless amusement.</p>

On the cutting edge of technology, we want something more. We want lighting capable of being a VU meter when occasion calls for a rager. We want to be able to feel the flicker of campfire or experience blue skies... why not have it all?</p>
              <p class="opacity-0 transition-opacity delay-100 duration-700" data-scroll data-scroll-repeat data-scroll-class="opacity-100">This event lighting project spanned over 3000 utlra_bright LEDs, contained over a kilometer of wires and survived some very extreme weather conditions. Several predefined lighting patterns allowed the overall lighting system to provide mood lighting or responsive music lighting depending on need or occassion. For those of you who might be concerned about polar bears, you can rest easy knowing that this entire setup was powered by 750W power supply but averaged around 300W mark using ~1% of available power.</p>

At Littl3.1 we stand behind our engineering and we stand behind our community. For this reason, we are transient and any anti-advertising is the integral part of elaborate and delicate ploy to deter an entire generation of individuals who feel entitled to lives they don’t want to work for. Further, experience has shown us that we may need to take a moment to provide some interpretational guidelines. We choose our words with great care and with much deliberation. In particular, any reference to laziness does not imply procrastination, tardiness, or sloth. On the contrary, it refers to disciplined mastery of finding easy ways to perform difficult tasks.
